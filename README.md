# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is an interactive web-based application that helps users understand and analyze various sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations. This tool is designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning how sorting algorithms work.

## Features

- **Supported Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Shell Sort
- **Real-Time Visualizations:**
  - Step-by-step execution of algorithms.
  - Visual representation of data swapping and comparisons.
- **Customizable Input Data:**
  - Generate random arrays of various sizes.
  - Adjust sorting speed.
  - Input custom data arrays.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Measure and display the time complexity (in steps or milliseconds).
  - Compare sorting times for different algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive controls and clear visual feedback.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
2. **Open in your browser:**
   Run the file App.java to see the application

## Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.
2. Customize the array size or input your own array.
3. Start the visualization to see how the algorithm works.
4. Adjust the speed slider to control the animation speed.
5. View the performance metrics displayed after the sorting completes.
6. AI-assisted features like tutoring and voice mode.
